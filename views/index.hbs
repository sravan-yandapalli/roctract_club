    <h1 id="au">About Us</h1>
    <p>Rotaract clubs were founded in 1968 by Rotary International, a worldwide association of service-minded professional leaders. Rotaract clubs bring together people of ages 18-30 to exchange ideas with leaders in the community, develop leadership and professional skills, and have fun through service. Today there are over 10,904 Rotary-supported Rotaract clubs with more than 250,792 members in some 184 countries around the world. Rotaract is the collegiate level of Rotary International and related to the Interact Club from high school. Rotaract members decide how to organize and run their clubs, manage their own funds, and plan and carry out activities and service projects. Rotary club sponsors offer guidance and support and work with your club as partners in service.<br>
